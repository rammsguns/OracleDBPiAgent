## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- Oracle 19c DBA agent with 12 typed database tools, CLI ask/chat/doctor,
  bounded execution and credential-free audit records. Read-only SQL policy,
  per-session version gate, approved targets and local-only Strata protect access.
  See [compatibility and safety](docs/compatibility-19c.md).
- Local web UI with streamed chat, tool trace, health, stop controls and browser
  coverage; Report tab and Markdown export. See [web UI](docs/web-ui.md).
- Fourteen fixed read-only report sections, optional local summaries, saved
  reports and deterministic diffs for externally scheduled runs. See [reports](docs/report.md).
- Evidence grounding with at most one numeric correction for agent answers and
  Unverified notes for answers and report summaries. See [grounding](docs/grounding.md).
- Sequential MVP and hard evals, optimization diagnostics, expanded 49-case
  hard suite and bootstrap token comparisons. See [eval methodology](docs/evals-hard.md).
- Node 24 CI for clean installs, typecheck, unit tests and build, without database
  access, LLM calls or secrets. See [CI](docs/ci.md).

### Changed

- Promoted harness and metadata/prompt improvements, query-error hints and
  requested decimal preservation. Token comparisons remain advisory; rejected
  tool experiments are excluded. See [optimization](docs/model-optimization.md)
  and [phase results](PLAN.md).
